# Contributing to VisualTorch

We welcome your feedbacks and contributions!

## Bug Report and Feature Request

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. If you want to report a bug or request a feature, please create a new issue [here](https://github.com/willyfh/visualtorch/issues). Please make sure there are no existing issues to avoid duplication.

## Discussion

The [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/willyfh/visualtorch/discussions/) is enabled in visualtorch to help the community asking questions and/or propose ideas/solutions.

## Development & PRs

### Â Getting Started

#### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork the VisualTorch repository by following the GitHub documentation on [forking a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo). fter forking, clone your forked repository to your local machine, and then create a new branch from the `main`` branch."

#### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Set up your development environment to begin contributing. This includes installing the necessary dependencies and configuring pre-commit hooks for code quality checks. Please note that this guide assumes you are using Conda for package management, but the steps are similar for other package managers.

##### Development Environment Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate a new Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n visualtorch_env python=3.10
   conda activate visualtorch_env
   ```

2. Install the development requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

3. Install and configure pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

Pre-commit hooks help ensure code quality and consistency. After each commit,
`pre-commit` will automatically run the configured checks for the changed file.
To manually run the checks for all files, use:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Making Changes

1. **Write Code:** Follow the project's coding standards and write your code with clear intent. Ensure your code is well-documented and includes examples where appropriate. For code quality we use `ruff``.

2. **Add Tests:** If your code includes new functionality, add corresponding tests using `pytest`.

3. **Update Documentation:** If you've changed APIs or added new features, update the documentation accordingly.

4. **Pass Tests and Quality Checks:** Ensure the test suite passes and that your code meets quality standards by running:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   pytest tests/
   ```

5. **Check Licensing:** Ensure you either own the code or have the rights to use it, in accordance with the appropriate licensing.

### Submitting Pull Requests

After completing the necessary steps and ensuring your changes meet the requirements:

1. Push your changes to your forked repository.
2. Visit the original VisualTorch repository you forked and select "New pull request".
3. Choose your fork and the relevant branch with your changes to create a pull request.
4. Provide all necessary details about your modifications.
